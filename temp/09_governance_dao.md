# DAO Governance in Fractal Network

## Introduction

The governance of Fractal Network is based on a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) system that allows network participants to make collective decisions about the project's development and direction. This approach ensures that all stakeholders have a voice in the platform's evolution. **The introduction of the F2P-inspired economic model (detailed in `08_economic_model.md`) significantly expands the scope of DAO governance, particularly concerning the management of Agent operational modes, Guardian contributions, the Algorithmic Central Bank (ACB), the Economic AI (AEA), and associated incentive systems.**

## Governance Structure

Governance is organized in multiple layers, where holders of the $FRAC token can participate in decision-making through a voting system. Decisions can include:

- Proposals for protocol improvements.
- Changes to the economic structure, **including parameters for the F2P model, Agent modes (Explorer, Operator, Guardian, Hybrid), and Guardian task incentives.**
- Adjustments to staking and slashing parameters **for both Custodians and Guardians.**
- Selection of new Fractal Custodians.
- **Approval or modification of parameters suggested by the Algorithmic Central Bank (ACB) and the Economic AI (AEA).**
- **Defining rules and reward structures for Productive Gamification.**
- **Setting policies for the reputation system, including how reputation is earned and lost.**

## Voting Process

$FRAC holders can submit proposals and vote on them. The voting process includes:

1.  **Proposal Submission**: Any $FRAC holder (or a holder meeting a certain threshold) can submit a proposal, which will be reviewed by the community.
2.  **Discussion Period**: A period is established for community members to discuss the proposal and suggest modifications.
3.  **Voting**: At the end of the discussion period, a vote is held. Votes are weighted according to the amount of $FRAC each participant holds. **The potential for reputation to also influence voting weight, especially for active Guardians or Custodians, may be considered in future governance enhancements.**
4.  **Implementation**: If the proposal is approved, it is implemented on the network.

## Incentives and Rewards for Governance Participation

To encourage active participation in governance, incentives are implemented:

- **Rewards for Participation**: Participants who vote and contribute to discussions may receive rewards (e.g., in $SOLV or through other mechanisms).
- **Staking $FRAC**: $FRAC holders stake their tokens not only for network security (as Custodians or Guardians) but also to participate and increase their influence in governance.

## DAO's Role in the New Economic Model

The DAO plays a crucial role in overseeing and fine-tuning the F2P-inspired economic model:

- **Parameter Control**: The DAO has the ultimate authority to set and adjust critical economic parameters, such as:
    - $FRAC staking requirements for Guardian mode.
    - $SOLV issuance rules and ACB operational parameters (e.g., target inflation, $FRAC backing ratios for $SOLV).
    - Fee structures for different Agent modes.
    - Reward rates for Guardian tasks and gamification achievements.
    - Slashing percentages and conditions for Custodians and Guardians.
    - Thresholds and limits for Explorer mode access.
- **Oversight of ACB and AEA**: While the ACB manages $SOLV issuance and the AEA provides economic analysis and suggestions, the DAO reviews and approves their core policies and significant parameter changes. This ensures human oversight and community alignment for automated economic mechanisms.
- **Evolution of the Model**: The DAO is responsible for approving major changes or evolutions to the economic model itself, ensuring it remains aligned with the network's long-term goals and community consensus.

## Transparency and Auditability

The governance of Fractal Network is based on transparency. All proposals, discussions, and voting results are publicly accessible. Additionally, an audit system is implemented that allows community members to verify the integrity of the decisions made.

## Conclusion

The DAO governance of Fractal Network is an essential component that allows the community to actively participate in the platform's evolution. Through a transparent voting process and an incentive system, it seeks to ensure that the network develops in a way that benefits all its participants. **The expanded responsibilities under the new economic model make the DAO a central pillar for maintaining the balance, fairness, and sustainability of the entire Fractal ecosystem.**
